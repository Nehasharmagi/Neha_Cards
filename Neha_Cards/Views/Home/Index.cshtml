        <p class="font-weight-bold" style="color: #CF3B1B">A playing card is a piece of specially prepared card stock, heavy paper, thin cardboard, plastic-coated paper, cotton-paper blend, or thin plastic that is marked with distinguishing motifs. Often the front (face) and back of each card has a finish to make handling easier. They are most commonly used for playing card games, and are also used in magic tricks, cardistry,card throwing, and card houses; cards may also be collected. Some patterns of Tarot playing card are also used for divination, although bespoke cards for this use are more common.Playing cards are typically palm-sized for convenient handling, and usually are sold together in a set as a deck of cards or pack of cards.</p>
